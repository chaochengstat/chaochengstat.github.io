## Personal Information

My name is **Chao Cheng** (Chinese: **程超**). Currently, I am a Postgraduate Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University under the supervision of Prof. [Donna Spiegelman](https://publichealth.yale.edu/cmips/profile/donna_spiegelman/). My research interests mainly focus on measurement error correction, statistical genetics and biostatistical methods. I am also interested in time series analysis and its application on financal datasets. 

Before coming to Yale, I obtained a Master degree in Applied Statistics from Tsinghua University advised by Prof. [Ying Yang](http://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/math/2566/2019/20190705132947764835711/20190705132947764835711_.html), and a Bachelor degree in Finance at Donghua University advised by Prof. [Man Wang](http://glxy.dhu.edu.cn/76/ab/c3179a30379/page.htm). Moreover, I was also a visiting student under the supervision of Prof. [Heping Zhang](https://publichealth.yale.edu/profile/heping_zhang/) at Yale (Summer, 2019) and Prof. [Molin Wang](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/molin-wang/) at Harvard (Summer, 2018).
