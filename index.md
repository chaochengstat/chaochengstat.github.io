## Personal Information

My name is Chao Cheng (Chinese: 程超). Currently, I am a Postgraduate Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University under the supervision of Prof. Donna Spiegelman. My research interests mainly focus on measurement error correction, statistical genetics and biostatistical methods. I am also interested in time series analysis and its application on Financal datasets. Before coming to Yale, I obtained my Master degree in Applied Statistics from Tsinghua University advised by Prof. Ying Yang, and Bachelor degree in Finance from Donghua University advised by Prof. Man Wang.
